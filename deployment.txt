This is a workaround for the issue that we are currently unable to deploy directly to clojars from Eclipse / m2eclipse

1. Run Maven install
2. Run "pageant" and open the relevant private key "mikera-clojars-ssh.ppk"
3. Open command prompt
4. cd to the repository directory e.g. "~.m2/repository/net/mikera/clisk/0.4.1"
5. Run command as follows (including semicolon at end)

pscp -scp *.pom *.jar clojars@clojars.org:

This should deploy successfully to clojars via SCP.
